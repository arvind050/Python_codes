'''what is an iterator?
Iterator is an object which can be iterated upon and which implement the iterator protocol which are __iter__ and __next__
methods on iterables(list,tuple,set etc)

iterators vs iterables
 
iterator is an object which will give only one value at a time but iterables give all the values at once
iterator is derived from iterable using a function or method name __iter__

the __next__ method

the next method is used on the iterator object to fetch the elements of iterator object one by one.'''
