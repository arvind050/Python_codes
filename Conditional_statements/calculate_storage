'''If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still 
use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, 
can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes 
needed to store a file of a given size?'''
