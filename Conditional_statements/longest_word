'''Question 7
The longest_word function is used to compare 3 words. It should return the word with the most number of 
characters (and the first in the list when they have the same length). 
'''

def longest_word(word1,word2,word3):
    if len(word1) >= len(word2) and len(word1) >= len(word3):
        word = word1 + ' is the longest'
    elif len(word2) > len(word1) and len(word2) > len(word3):
        word = word2 + ' is the longest'
    else:
        word = word3 + ' is the longest'
    return word

print(longest_word("chair", "couch", "table"))
print(longest_word("bed", "bath", "beyond"))
print(longest_word("laptop", "notebook", "desktop"))
            
'''Output
chair is the longest
beyond is the longest
notebook is the longest

#output
