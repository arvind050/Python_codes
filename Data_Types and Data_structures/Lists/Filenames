'''Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this,
 we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in 
 the code using any of the methods youâ€™ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.'''
