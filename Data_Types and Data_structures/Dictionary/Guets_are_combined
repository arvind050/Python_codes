'''Taylor and Rory are hosting a party. They sent out invitations, and each one collected responses into 
dictionaries, with names of their friends and how many guests each friend is bringing. Each dictionary is a 
partial list, but Rory's list has more current information about the number of guests. Fill in the blanks to 
combine both dictionaries into one, with each friend listed only once, and the number of guests from Rory's 
dictionary taking precedence, if a name is included in both dictionaries. Then print the resulting dictionary'''
