'''A professor with two assistants, Jamie and Drew, wants an attendance list of the students, in the order that 
they arrived in the classroom. Drew was the first one to note which students arrived, and then Jamie took over. 
After the class, they each entered their lists into the computer and emailed them to the professor, who needs to 
combine them into one, in the order of each student's arrival. Jamie emailed a follow-up, saying that her list is 
in reverse order. Complete the steps to combine them into one list'''

def combine_lists(list1,list2):
	new = list2
	for i in reversed(list1):
		new.append(i)
	return new


Jamies_list = ["Alice", "Cindy", "Bobby", "Jan", "Peter"]
Drews_list = ["Mike", "Carol", "Greg", "Marcia"]

print(combine_lists(Jamies_list, Drews_list))

#Output
#['Mike', 'Carol', 'Greg', 'Marcia', 'Peter', 'Jan', 'Bobby', 'Cindy', 'Alice']
